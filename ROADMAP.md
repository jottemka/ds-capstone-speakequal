## Project Roadmap

### Week 1
- Preparing workspace
- Get in touch with the challenge
- Find infos and papers on speaker diarization
- Apply some rapid prototyping to find the pros/cons of the models

### Week 2
- Find out which approach is applicable and put more effort into it
- DIART seems promising, but is it really applicable? Getting more into detail on DIART configuration. E.g. VAD, Thresholds to reduce confusion
- Getting more into detail on i- and x-vectors
- We need more labeled audio data. Where to get it? Can we provide audio data as a simulated live stream?
- Create mid-term presentation

### Week 3
- Train the underlaying embedding model ourselves
- Instead of "speaker0" show the real name => Speaker detection with prior training
- Perform live-tests in real world environment. E.g. Webcalls, Room microphone, Phone Microphone
- Finalize the User Interface

### Week 4
- Prepare the final presentation
- Clean up the repo
- Create documentation
